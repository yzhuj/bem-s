    "In this file we compute electric field or potential on some spatial points(called `grid`) for all electrode voltage configurations(i.e. one eletrode is 1V and the rest 0V).Major calculations calls `fastlap` C library which uses a pre-conditioned, adaptive, multipole-accelerated algorithm for solving Laplace problem. Two parameters control multipole acceleration.\n",

    "1. `solve_singularities()` solves charge distributions by iterative methods to make it consistent with one electrode at 1V and others at 0V (unit potentials). `adapt_mesh()` refines meshes adaptively to achieve certain precision while solving sigulartities.\n",
    "2. Compute potentials on given grid points by `simulate()`, based on the charge distributions gotten previously.\n",
    "3. Potential data of each unit potential are saved seperately to a `Result` instance, and also export to VTK files.\n",
    "4. Return total accumulated charge per electrode in the end.\n",

    "* for reference, this file in my laptop(macbook pro, 2 physical kernels) runs 800s\n",
